The vanilla LDA is an unsupervised model to learn the latent semantic structure.
For supervised LDA, it tries to incorporate side information.

Topic models using Max Likelihood estimate (MLE) may get trapped in local optima.
Spectral decomposition and Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) are used to get around MLE NP-hard problem.

NMF has been used with LDA for a supervised LDA.
This paper uses spectral method for supervised LDA.
