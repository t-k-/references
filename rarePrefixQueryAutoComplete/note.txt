Improve systems that can only recommend queries for prefixes that have been previously seen by the search engine with adequate frequency. 

Explore ranking signals that are appropriate for both types of candidates based on n-gram statistics and a convolutional latent semantic model (CLSM). 

We propose an additional candidate generation strategy for QAC
by mining popular query suffixes. Candidate suffixes are popular
n-grams that appear at the ends of queries. By appending such
n-grams suffixes to a userâ€™s query prefix we can generate synthetic
suggestion candidates that have never been observed in the historical
query logs. Table 1 contains examples of such suggestions. We
further propose a supervised framework for ranking these synthetic
queries alongside the traditional full-query suggestion candidates.
We also explore new ranking signals in this framework, based on
the query n-gram statistics and a deep convolutional latent semantic
model (CLSM)
