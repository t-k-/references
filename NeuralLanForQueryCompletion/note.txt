A language model that employs neural networks to resolve the dimensionality problem with a distributed representation of text is open called a neural language model.

This paper: RNN + first neural language model.

To deal with previously unseen queries which makes MPC bad perform.

"our neural language models signicantly outperform Char n-gram for both seen and unseen prefixes.
