abstract={The main goal of existing word spotting approaches for searching document images has been the identification of visually similar word images in the absence of high quality text recognition output. Searching for a piece of arbitrary text is not possible unless the user identifies a sample word image from the document collection or generates the query word image synthetically. To address this problem, a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework is proposed for searching document images and shown to be effective for searching arbitrary text in real time for books printed in English (Latin script), Telugu and Ottoman scripts. The English experiments demonstrate that the dependencies between the visual terms and letter bigrams can be automatically learned using noisy OCR output. It is also shown that OCR text search accuracy can be significantly improved if it is combined with the proposed approach. No commercial OCR engine is available for Telugu or Ottoman script. In these cases the dependencies are trained using manually annotated document images. It is demonstrated that the trained model can be directly used to resolve arbitrary text queries across books despite font type and size differences. The proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art BLSTM baseline in these contexts.},

abstract={In content-based image retrieval, SIFT feature and the feature from deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance. To fully explore both visual features in a unified framework for effective and efficient retrieval, we propose a collaborative index embedding method to implicitly integrate the index matrices of them. We formulate the index embedding as an optimization problem from the perspective of neighborhood sharing and solve it with an alternating index update scheme. After the iterative embedding, only the embedded CNN index is kept for on-line query, which demonstrates significant gain in retrieval accuracy, with very economical memory cost. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the public datasets with million-scale distractor images. The experimental results reveal that, compared with the recent state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms, our approach achieves competitive accuracy performance with less memory overhead and efficient query computation.},

title={Spectral Learning for Supervised Topic Models}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={PP},

abstract={Supervised topic models simultaneously model the latent topic structure of large collections of documents and a response variable associated with each document. Existing inference methods are based on variational approximation or Monte Carlo sampling, which often suffers from the local minimum defect. Spectral methods have been applied to learn unsupervised topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), with provable guarantees. This paper investigates the possibility of applying spectral methods to recover the parameters of supervised LDA (sLDA). We first present a two-stage spectral method, which recovers the parameters of LDA followed by a power update method to recover the regression model parameters. Then, we further present a single-phase spectral algorithm to jointly recover the topic distribution matrix as well as the regression weights. Our spectral algorithms are provably correct and computationally efficient. We prove a sample complexity bound for each algorithm and subsequently derive a sufficient condition for the identifiability of sLDA. Thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the theory and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the spectral algorithms. In fact, our results on a large-scale review rating dataset demonstrate that our single-phase spectral algorithm alone gets comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods, while previous work on spectral methods has rarely reported such promising performance.},
