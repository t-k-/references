abstract="The retrieval of OCR degraded text using n-gram formulations within a probabilistic retrieval system is examined in this paper. Direct retrieval of documents using n-gram databases of 2 and 3-grams or 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams resulted in improved retrieval performance over standard (word based) queries on the same data when a level of 10 percent degradation or worse was achieved. A second method of using n-grams to identify appropriate matching and near matching terms for query expansion which also performed better than using standard queries is also described. This method was less effective than direct n-gram query formulations but can likely be improved with alternative query component weighting schemes and measures of term similarity. Finally, a web based retrieval application using n-gram retrieval of OCR text and display, with query term highlighting, of the source document image is described.",
